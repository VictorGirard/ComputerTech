### This week work ###
## Install and start using MySQL to create databases and manage users ##

* Log in into mysql on your Linux machine **as a root**

* Check the list of available databases

* Create a new database and give it a name on your own choice

* Grant access to the database for a non-root user you have previously created

* Log in a **non-root user**, switch to the newly created database and start working with it (see next slide)

* Create a table and name it accordingly

* Add **50 records to your table** (you can use data of any category)

* View the necessary records, using **at least 3 different filters** (depending on which category of data you have created, but filtering by ID is mandatory)

* **Update 10 records** (change them how ever you would like to) - SHOW the difference of how they looked before and after applied changes;

* Delete **5 records**, show the difference of how the data table looks after applied changes

* \*Feel free to apply other MySQL operations to the database
